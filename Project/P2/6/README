# How to
#

1. select a problem to solve, e.g. 12
2. create a corresponding problem-12.tex file, based on the two samples provided (12 and 78)
3a. DO NOT ADD anything in the preamble of the problem tex file
3b. DO NOT EDIT the style file
3c. if you need special packages, please contact the teaching team
4a. for tables follow the format in sample problem 78 (ie. use booktabs package)
4b. for figures name the external files with respect to the problem they belong to and add _letter at the end, eg. problem-12_a.png, problem-12_b.png, etc.
5. compile either each problem individually or the whole catalog
6. if compilation fails, fix the code. files that fail compiling will be REJECTED

#
# bibliography

- for each problem create a .bib file, eg. problem12.bib
- include all necessary reference
- DO NOT COPY/PASTE the project content or you will be sent to HC
